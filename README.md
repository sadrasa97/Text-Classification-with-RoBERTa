Got it! Here's a simplified README for a project with just one main file (`main.py`) and one requirement (`requirements.txt`):

# Text Classification with RoBERTa

This project implements text classification using RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model, to classify text data into two categories: Racism and Xenophobia.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: Python script for training the RoBERTa model, evaluating it, and making predictions on new text samples.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadrasa97/text-classification-roberta.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by creating Excel files containing text samples labeled with their respective categories (racism or xenophobia).

2. Update the `xenophobia.xlsx` and `racism.xlsx` files with your dataset.

3. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will train the RoBERTa model, evaluate it on a test dataset, and make predictions on new text samples.
